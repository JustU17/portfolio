    <h4>YOUR JACK OF ALL TRADES CREATIVE FRIEND!</h4>

    <main text-align="justify">
    	<p>You can call me, Just! I’m a 22-years-old passionate designer who currently takes Multimedia Arts and is a Student-Artist Scholar under Benilde Culture and Arts Unit in De Lasalle College of Saint Benilde.<br> Alongside having my own start-up bag business (Dear Blank PH) and agency (Just U Design Studio) that caters social media management and other creative needs!</p>


			<p>I love being in the creative industry – digital, traditional and performance art. Through different forms of art, I’m confident and passionate about it. Growing up as an artist brings light and life to me and was able to create art for the community, organization, workplace and the like in my early age.<br> This makes me want to share who I am today and inspire the creative junkie like me through my works and experience.</p>
